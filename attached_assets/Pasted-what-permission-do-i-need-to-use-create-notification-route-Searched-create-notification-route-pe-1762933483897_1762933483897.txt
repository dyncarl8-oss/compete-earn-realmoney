Searched create notification API key permissions 401 unauthorized

Searched notification API key permissions scope required
Based on the error and documentation, you're getting a 401 error because you're using an App API key, but the create notification route doesn't require any special permissions.

The issue is likely that:

Your API key is invalid or expired - Double-check the key in your environment variables
You're not properly authenticating - Ensure you're passing the API key correctly in the Authorization header as Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
Your app isn't installed on the company - The company (biz_EfM4YDzQmtSt1P) must have your app installed
The notification API only requires that the experience belongs to your app (for experience notifications) or the company has your app installed (for company notifications). No additional permission scopes are needed.
